This Elgin pocket watch has been completely serviced cleaned, oiled and timed with new mainspring installed. The serial number dates this 12 size (measures 1 3\/4&quot; in diameter not including the pendant) 17 jewels pocket watch to the year 1917. This Elgin features an oversize metal dial that looks clean an does not have the usual soiling found around the hour markers as most do. The beige dial has black Arabic hour markers with sub-second dial having tiny black Arabics in ten second intervals. Elgin pocket watch is pendant wind and set which works properly, with crown in good condition. The blue steel &quot;Whip&quot; style minute hand and &quot;Spade&quot; style hour hand as well as second hand are in very good condition. The bevelded glass crystal is new! The movement reads: ELGIN NAT&#39;L WATCH CO...U.S.A...ADJUSTED...DOUBLE ROLLER...17 JEWELS. Movement bridges are bright and clean with regulator centered for adjustment either way if necessary.
